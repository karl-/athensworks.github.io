Athensworks, in partnership with Ohio Brew Week, built an iOS application for Ohio Brew Week. This was done by a group of volunteers and members at Athensworks in a monthly event we call Hack Night.  If you're interested in Hack Night, checkout our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/Athensworks?_rdr=p) each month. If you're interested in a membership, we'd love to have you join Athensworks!

*Unfortunately, we don't have an Android or Web application this year, but we hope to in the future. If you see any of the developers or designers at Brew Week, buy them a beer! Maybe next year they'll add more features and add more platforms.*
