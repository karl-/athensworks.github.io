Everything Local
-------------------
*March 22nd, 6 pm to 8 pm*

Learn about what the members of Athensworks and Athens community are up to.  This is an open event where we ask people to give one minute presentations about they or their company is working on. There will be a time for people to mingle with participants throughout the evnt.  All types of projects welcome.

If you have a project, [Apply to Present](https://docs.google.com/a/rickychilcott.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dElRVVg1SmpMSGliOUhNTVQ2cG5FR3c6MQ) at Everything Local. Submit this form by Saturday, March 16 to be considered for one of the sixty-second presentation spots. We’re looking for projects the general public will find interesting or significant. We won’t consider the financial, strategic, or organizational details of your project.

Hack Night
----------
*Third Thursday of every month, starting at 6 pm*

We host a hack night every month. **What's a hack night, you ask?** Programmers, designers, and creatives of all shapes, sizes, ages, and skill levels come together to tackle a project.  There isn't a plan until we get there.  We provide some food, drinks and an open space.  You bring ideas, computers, and a willingness to ship something real that night.
